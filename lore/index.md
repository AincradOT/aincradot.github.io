# Aincrad Lore & History

Aincrad is an anime-inspired progression MMO set within **the tower**—a mysterious vertical labyrinth of ever-changing levels. Players form guilds of Pathfinders, regroup and trade in Plazas, and challenge each Level's Warden to unlock the next rise.

## The Tower

The game is set in an endless, seasonal, shifting labyrinth of levels inside **the tower**. The labyrinth reconfigures over time as routes and configurations rewrite themselves, making exploration and progression a dynamic experience.

## The Shift

Every season begins with **the Shift**—a seasonal update that introduces new Levels, Wardens, mechanics, and content. The labyrinth reconfigures, routes rewrite themselves, and Pathfinders race to push higher through the new challenges.

## The Pathfinders

Players form **guilds of Pathfinders**—elite adventurers who push forward to unlock new Levels and face the most dangerous content.

## Game Mechanics

* **Wardens** - Each Level has a powerful boss that must be defeated to unlock the next rise
* **Plazas** - Safe zones where players regroup, trade, and prepare for their next challenge
* **Progression** - Advance through Levels by defeating Wardens and completing challenges
