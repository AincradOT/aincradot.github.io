We offer a **Premium subscription** that provides quality-of-life features such as:

The majority of our shop offerings are **cosmetic only**, ensuring that gameplay advantages cannot be purchased. Store credits can be earned through active participation and community contributions, making premium features accessible to all dedicated players.

!!!info Global Server Boosts
Typical "boosts" like experience and loot bonuses that you might see on other servers for individuals are applied instead **globally at the server level** and affect **all players equally**. These bonuses (such as 1-hour exp or loot boosts) are server-wide events, not individual purchases, ensuring fair gameplay for everyone.
