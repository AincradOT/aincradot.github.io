# Aincrad Lore & History

Aincrad is an anime-inspired progression MMO set within **the labyrinth**—a mysterious vertical realm of ever-changing Levels inside the tower. Players form guilds of Pathfinders, regroup and trade in Plazas, and challenge each Level's Warden to unlock the next rise.

## The Tower and the Labyrinth

The game is set in an endless, seasonal, shifting labyrinth of Levels inside **the tower**. The labyrinth is a mysterious vertical realm where the very structure shifts and changes over time. This ever-changing environment presents unique challenges as routes and configurations rewrite themselves, making exploration and progression a dynamic experience.

## Level Progression

Each Level of the labyrinth presents unique challenges and environments:

* **Lower Levels (1-20):** Beginner areas with basic monsters and quests
* **Mid Levels (21-50):** Increasing difficulty with stronger enemies
* **Upper Levels (51-75):** Dangerous territories requiring skilled parties
* **High Levels (76-99):** Elite areas with powerful bosses
* **Level 100:** The final challenge—the ultimate Warden awaits

## The Pathfinders

Players form **guilds of Pathfinders**—elite adventurers who push forward to unlock new Levels. These brave groups face the most dangerous content, racing against time to progress higher before the Shift begins.

## The Shift

The labyrinth reconfigures over time. Every season, Pathfinders race to push higher before the Shift begins and the routes rewrite themselves. This seasonal reset creates urgency and competition as players work to establish progress before the realm reshapes.

## Game Mechanics in the Labyrinth

* **Wardens** - Each Level has a powerful boss that must be defeated to unlock the next rise
* **Plazas** - Safe zones where players regroup, trade, and prepare for their next challenge
* **Guilds** - Form groups of Pathfinders to tackle the most dangerous content together
* **Unique Systems** - Vocations and crafting add depth to the labyrinth experience
* **Progression** - Advance through Levels by defeating Wardens and completing challenges

!!!tip Survival
Form guilds with other players. Teamwork makes progressing through Levels much easier and more efficient, especially when racing against the Shift.
