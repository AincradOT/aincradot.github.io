# Aincrad Lore & History

Welcome to Aincrad, the floating castle from Sword Art Online—a 100-floor tower where adventurers must fight their way to the top.

## The World of Aincrad

Aincrad is a massive floating castle suspended in the sky, consisting of 100 distinct floors. Each floor represents a unique environment with its own challenges, monsters, and treasures. The tower was created as the setting for an epic MMORPG adventure.

## Floor Progression

Each floor of Aincrad presents unique challenges:

* **Lower Floors (1-20):** Beginner areas with basic monsters and quests
* **Mid Floors (21-50):** Increasing difficulty with stronger enemies
* **Upper Floors (51-75):** Dangerous territories requiring skilled parties
* **High Floors (76-99):** Elite areas with powerful bosses
* **Floor 100:** The final challenge—the ultimate boss awaits

## The Clearers

Elite players who push forward to clear new floors are known as "Clearers." These brave adventurers face the most dangerous content, paving the way for others to progress.
