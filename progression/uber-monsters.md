# Uber Monster System

Enhanced versions of existing monsters that spawn randomly with unique modifiers and increased difficulty.

## Overview

Uber monsters are rare, powerful variants of regular monsters that have a **5% chance** to respawn as uber when a normal monster dies. They feature special abilities, stat modifications, and unique combat mechanics that make them significantly more challenging than their normal counterparts.

Every uber monster receives **one modifier** that significantly changes their behavior and combat mechanics.

## Uber Tiers

Uber monsters come in four tiers, each with increasing difficulty and rewards:

| Tier | Skull | Health | Experience | Damage Bonus | Loot Boost | Item Level |
|------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **White** | White Skull | 1.5x | 1.5x | +25% | +25% | +10% |
| **Green** | Green Skull | 2.5x | 2.5x | +50% | +50% | +15% |
| **Red** | Red Skull | 5x | 5x | +100% | +75% | +20% |
| **Black** | Black Skull | 10x | 10x | +150% | +100% | +25% |

### Tier Distribution

When a monster respawns as uber, the tier distribution is:
* **75%** White Skull
* **10%** Green Skull
* **10%** Red Skull
* **5%** Black Skull

## Uber Modifiers

!!!danger Strategy
Uber monsters are significantly more powerful than their normal counterparts, with higher tiers being exponentially more dangerous. Always be prepared for their unique modifiers and plan your approach accordingly. Higher tier ubers (Red and Black skull) require careful coordination and preparation.
