# Reward Orb System

Reward orbs are special drops that appear when skulled monsters (uber monsters) die, containing gold and crafting currency.

## Overview

When a skulled monster dies, it has a **100% chance** to drop reward orbs. These orbs spawn near the monster's death location and must be collected by standing on them (or auto-looted if enabled). Each orb contains money and crafting currency used in the [Item Crafting](crafting.md) system.

## Orb Collection

* Orbs spawn over **10 seconds** with visual effects
* Players must **stand on the orb** to collect it (unless auto-loot is enabled)
* All players who damaged the monster are eligible to receive orbs
* Red and Black skull monsters have a **20% chance** to drop **2 orbs** instead of 1

## Rewards

Reward orbs drop money and crafting currency. The amount of money and type of crafting currency varies based on the monster's skull tier and base HP. Higher tier monsters drop more valuable rewards. Crafting currency is used to modify and improve equipment in the [Item Crafting](crafting.md) system.
