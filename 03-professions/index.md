# Vocations in Aincrad

Aincrad uses the classic Open Tibia TFS (The Forgotten Server) vocation system. Choose your vocation to define your character's role, abilities, and playstyle.

## Vocation Basics

Each vocation has unique strengths, weaknesses, and specializations. Your choice of vocation determines:

* **Combat style** - Melee, ranged, or magic
* **Spell arsenal** - Unique spells and abilities
* **Stat progression** - How your character's attributes grow
* **Equipment preferences** - Optimal gear for your playstyle

## Available Vocations

| Vocation   | Role           | Primary Damage | Specialization                    |
| ----------| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **[Knight](knight.md)** | Tank/Melee DPS | Physical       | High HP, strong melee combat      |
