## What is Aincrad?

[!badge variant="primary" text="MMORPG"] [!badge variant="success" text="Closed Beta"]

Aincrad is an anime-inspired progression MMO set within **the labyrinth**—a mysterious vertical realm of ever-changing Levels. Players form guilds of Pathfinders, regroup and trade in Plazas, and challenge each Level's Warden to unlock the next rise. The labyrinth reconfigures over time. Every season, Pathfinders race to push higher before the Shift begins and the routes rewrite themselves.
